### Parsing Guest Accounts

This program is to aid adminstration of guest computing accounts for events. After requesting x number of accounts, the details for each account arrive in two separate emails. This program pulls those details together and puts them into a useful format to hand out to the event guests.

# Caveats

The emails are saved from MS Exchange, or Outlook on Windows into one text file, email_messages. In Exchange when multiple messages are selected, then they can be saved to one file, which makes this easier to manage.

A later version of this should also be able to reach into multiple files to gather the details, or to even go into MS Exchange or Outlook.
